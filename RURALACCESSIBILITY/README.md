# Accessibility Feature Segmentation and Evaluation

This repository contains the project files for developing a model to segment and evaluate accessibility features.  
Project Title: _Access, Accessibility, and Aging in Place in Rural Subsidized Housing and Neighborhoods: Addressing Data Gaps Using Secondary Data and Image Segmentation_

## Project Overview

This project aims to customize an existing model that segments accessibility features and performs accessibility evaluations. The model utilizes advanced image segmentation techniques (e.g., promptable panoptic segmentation) to identify and assess accessibility features in Google Street-view and Satellite-view images.
